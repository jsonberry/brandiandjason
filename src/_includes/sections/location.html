                The ceremony will take place on an uncovered patio. Seating will be offered on the patio and a covered portion of the adjoining atrium. This area will not have AC. The reception will be held directly afterward and will take place mostly inside the restaurant, which does have AC.

                We&CloseCurlyQuote;re requesting that their very short and sweet wedding ceremony be completely unplugged and cellphone/camera-free. We&CloseCurlyQuote;ll have a pretty fantastic photographer named Alex who will be documenting it to ensure that guests can enjoy the moment.<br /><br />
                As soon as the ceremony is over, feel free to pull out your camera for the reception and go crazy - take as many pictures as your heart desires! We only ask that you not share any pictures of the newlyweds on social media. Most of you already know how Brandi feels about people bein&CloseCurlyQuote; in her business.
