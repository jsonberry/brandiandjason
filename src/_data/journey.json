{"brandi":{"heading":"Brandi","copy":"Brandi is a California native who thoroughly enjoys reading, binge watching shows for the umpteenth time on Netflix and most types of physical activity. She spends her days as an Email Production Manager and her nights dreaming of running away to join the circus full time so she can get paid to wear brightly colored bodysuits while doing handstands on top of other humans."},"jason":{"heading":"Jason","copy":"Jason was born in Colorado but grew up in a suburb of Portland, OR. Growing up, he kept busy with video games, playing guitar, and entertaining a proclivity for computers. His earlier hobbies  later translated into an intense passion for coffee, a serious rock climbing hobby and a career in web development. This kick ass site you&CloseCurlyQuote;re perusing on your way to RSVP is a product of his."},"the_road_ahead":{"heading":"The road ahead","copy":"Jason and Brandi met NYE 2014. They started climbing together with friends at a bouldering gym. Bouldering sessions with groups turned into bouldering sessions with only each other, which led to post-climb burgers. Burgers turned into late night coffee and talking about books, which led to inappropriate jokes and a penchant for getting pizza at 2am so they could sustain themselves while binge watching the Walking Dead. Now, they want to watch the Walking Dead for the rest of their lives together. Marriage is the obvious next step."}}
